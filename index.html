<h2 style="font-family:Times New Roman", Times, serif;> Presentation of the project </h2>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman", Times, serif;> The roots of Rock 'n' Roll have been hotly discussed by music analysts and historians. There is widespread consensus that it emerged in the Southern United States - an area that produced the majority of the big early rock 'n' roll artists - through the convergence of numerous influences that embodied a fusion of African musical tradition and European equipment. Because of the migration of many former slaves and their descendants to major urban centers such as St. Louis, Memphis, New York City, Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, and Buffalo, black and white residents were living in closer proximity than ever before, hearing each other's music and even beginning to emulate each other's fashions. This process of "cultural collision" was facilitated by radio stations that made white and black forms of music available to both populations, the development and distribution of the vinyl record, and African-American musical styles such as jazz and swing that were adopted by white performers.The present project traces the rise of rock 'n' roll as a cultural phenomenon, examining data on album releases and highlighting influential rock artists and their contributions.</p>
