<h4 style="font-family:calibri;"> 1950's: The Birth of Rock & Roll </h4>
 <p align="justify";> The Big Band or Swing era of the 1930s and 1940s had a big influence on pop performers in the 1950s, who dominated the US pop charts with lush orchestration. In the early 1950s, Latin and calypso music became popular and introduced more dancing rhythms. Western Swing, a fast dance style, was popular in the 1930s and 1940s in country music. The late 40s and early 50s R&B charts included a blend of up-tempo jazz and blues, commonly described as jump blues, performed by small combos in a beat-heavy style. The music was mostly composed by and for black Americans. Covers of these new genres become Pop chart smashes for white pop musicians. R&B, Electric Blues, gospel, and country-influenced Rock and roll Over numerous years, many R&B performers helped shape the "rock and roll" sound. This slow transition and multiple inspirations make it hard to name the "first" rock and roll music, though there are several contenders.
</p>
<h4 style="font-family:calibri;"> 1960's - Expanding the Boundaries of Rock Music </h4>
<p align="justify";> Rock music completely dominated the charts in the 1960s, with only a few non-rock albums or songs charting.  Elvis Presley still has hits, but rock music diversifies with the folk revival, the Brill Building sound, Phil Spector's wall of sound, female groups, and surf music. At the same time, Motown, Stax, and Atlantic record labels brought more black performers to the mainstream charts. The sixties saw television dominate rock music as networks aim to lure younger audiences. Outdoor rock events started in the late 1960s. </p>
<h4 style="font-family:calibri;"> 1970's - Rock Music Becomes Big Business​ </h4>
<p align="justify";> All four Beatles members had successful solo careers after the breakup in 1970. Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison died at 27 in the early 1970s. Psychedelic music falls but becomes hard rock, progressive rock, and heavy metal. Touring musicians play sports arenas instead of clubs and theaters.  
The difference between Top 40 and FM album-oriented rock radio is evident. First, FM stereo radio, then 8-Track tapes, then cassette tapes, and car stereos became popular. New rock styles originate from a range of music distribution platforms and a growing market. Soft rock and singer-songwriters ruled the early 1970s. Glam or Glitter Rock momentarily shined in the early 1970s. Reggae leaves Jamaica for the globe. In the late 1970s, radio and dance floors were dominated by disco. Late seventies punk rock is a backlash to arena rock, progressive rock, and disco. Punk becomes New Wave when bands add synthesizers to guitars and percussion. Vintage rock nostalgia rose in the 1970s. Popular compilation CDs include multiple artists and genres. 
</p>
<h4 style="font-family:calibri;"> 1980's CDs, Synths, and the Rise of MTV </h4>
<p align="justify";> MTV debuted on 300 U.S. cable TV systems in 1981. MTV streams music videos 24/7 and delivers rock news. MTV was on 2,000 cable systems by 1983. VH1 debuts in 1984 with vintage rock. <br> 
Music videos' 24/7 marketing power has helped bring many new bands and music styles to the mainstream, including heavy metal, synthpop, new wave, rap, and hip hop. Singles and album sales show the number of successful female performers across genres. Many musicians sponsor charity recordings and concerts, including Band Aid, We Are The World, Live Aid, and Farm Aid. <br>
The 1982 launch of the CD, the first widely available digital audio format, accelerated the downfall of the vinyl album by the end of the decade. </p>
<h4 style="font-family:calibri;"> 1990's - The Internet and Digital Music </h4>
<p align="justify";> Hip-Hop grew in prominence and diversity in the 1990s. Alternative Rock, Grunge, and Pop Punk gained popularity and ironically became mainstream in the 1990s. Major labels start poaching indie bands from minor labels. The advent of Grateful Dead-influenced jam bands offers an alternative to radio play and mainstream success. Rap metal, rapcore, nu metal, and industrial metal evolve from heavy metal. Electronic music is evolving into trance, drum & bass, trip-hop, and eurodance from synthpop, techno, and house. <br>  
Britpop is coined in the UK as new bands Oasis and Blur compete for the top spot. Norah Jones, Sarah McLachlan, Alanis Morissette, Tori Amos, Jewel, Natalie Merchant, and Sheryl Crow are among the singer-songwriters experiencing a revival. <br> 
Thanks to computer and software advances, personal PCs can create and record digital music. The Internet and sound compression enable digital music dissemination without major label album releases. </p>

We retrieved album releases according to a chronological order. By looking at the chart, we can infer that the first registered albums date back to the mid-1950s.
These are just some of the instances of pioneering rock and roll albums:
  <br>
-	<i> Rock with Bill Haley and the Comets </i>, by Bill Haley & His Comets (1954); <br>
-	<i> Rock Around the Clock </i>, by Bill Haley & His Comets (1955); <br>
-	<i>Shake, Rattle and Roll </i>, by Bill Haley & His Comets (1955); <br>
-	<i> Elvis Presley </i>, by Elvis Presley (1956); <br>
-	<i> Rock, Rock, Rock </i>, by Chuck Berry (1956); <br>
-	<i> Elvis </i>, by Elvis Presley (1956). <br>
<br>
As the genre acquired popularity, we can observe an exponential growth in the number of albums releases. If we consider the number of releases between the 1950s and the 1960s, we can notice how, in the span of a decade alone, the amount of rock and roll albums published increased from 57 to 396. </p>

<h3 style="font-family:calibri;"> Rock 'n' roll in Italy </h3>
<p align="justify"; style="font-family:calibri;"> Rock and roll arrived in Italy in the second half of the 1950s, however it is only in the mid-1960s that this genre explodes in its popularity. Thanks to the Beat movement, Italy sees the emergence of the first Italian rock bands, which at the time provided a musical repertoire mainly consisting of cover of foreign hits. By the end of the decade, a real style of Italian rock seems to appear: the Italian progressive rock. This subgenre aimed at creating a counterculture around pop music by experimentation and exploration of sounds, rhythms and durations combined with the creation of evocative texts and concept albums. The trend later died down in the mid-1970s, when rock  itself into multiple new directions. </p>

<p align="justify"; style="font-family:calibri";> <i> <b> What are the major rock subgenres which are being played in Italy? </i> </b> <br>
<b> Psychedelic rock </b>: originated in the 1960s, this type of rock music is characterised by distorted guitars, experimental sounds and drug-induced lyrics. You can hear instance of this style by listening to Twenty Four Hours. <br>
<b> Hard rock </b>: emerged in the late 1960s, this genre is characterized by its heavy use of electric guitars, drums, and vocals. The rhythms of Essenza and Il Bacio della Medusa greatly encompass this genre. <br>
<b> Punk rock </b>: developed in the 1970s as a reaction against the excesses attributed to psychedelic and progressive rock, this subgenre was a simplified style of music that promoted simplicity and raw energy. Tre Allegri Ragazzi Morti, Banda Bassotti, Punkreas are just three of the vast range of Italian punk rock bands. <br>
<b> Alternative rock </b>: originated in the 1980s, one of its main characteristics is its experimentation with musical styles and its incorporation of elements from other genres, such as punk and folk. Måneskin and Afterhours are a famous example of this style. </p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify"; style="fornt-family:calibri";> The impact of rock and roll on popular culture is indescribable. It brought a new sound and energy to pop music and inspired a new generation of artists. It provided a platform for social change and helped to bring together people of different backgrounds, cultures, and races. Rock and roll has influenced fashion, art, and lifestyle, and still continues to be very powerful to this day. And just like Måneskin said when celebrating their victory at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2021, “Rock and roll never dies!” </p>
