<h2 style="font-family:Times New Roman", Times, serif;> Report </h2>
<p align="justify"; style="font-family:Times New Roman", Times, serif;> Initially, we made the decision to do a comprehensive search for generic information across various databases. When commencing my research into rock music musicians, we first explored the resources of Polifonia Corpus and DBpedia. However, we had challenges in obtaining relevant material pertaining to our chosen subject. Consequently, we choose to incorporate the use of Wikidata as an additional source to augment the narrative with pertinent information. Afterward, we began the process of devising a methodology for composing query code that would provide a desirable outcome. <br>
We made three attempts to retrieve information on musicians or singers whose genre covers 'rock'. At first, the results were presented in alphabetical order. After that, we modified the code twice to obtain the list in the order of the most influential or renowned rock musicians. <br>
<br>
The same method was used to obtain data related to different genres of rock music throughout diverse global regions. The initial two attempts provided outcomes characterized by an excessive number of replicated findings or a large number of unusual geographic names falling within the same classification. So we made the search criteria specific to the different genres of Italian rock. <br>
We then tried looking at albums published by rock bands during the years. We started by searching for the title and release date of music albums (all genres), then restricted it to albums pertaining to rock music and rock ‘n’ roll. The first try showed us results with duplicate dates, so we tried fixing the visualization by specifying the criteria and correctly grouping the dates together. <br>
<br>
In the meantime, the data was gathered and efforts were made to enhance the query code in order to obtain more precise information. This was done to help with the preparation of the  <a href="https://projects.dharc.unibo.it/melody/modify/1695058312.627918/revolutionary_rhythms">Melody story</a>, as well as the slide presentation and the draft of the article. <br>
</p>

<h3 style="font-family:Times New Roman", Times, serif;> Challenges </h3>
<p align="justify"; style="font-family:Times New Roman", Times, serif;> - We then wanted to find out which musical events related to rock music took place around the world, however our query returned very limited results. We tried to modify the query so that it looked for musical events in which a rock band had participated, but we eventually agreed that this solution was too generic and vague. We also tried using DBpedia for the same purpose, but we had the same problem we encountered when investigating Wikidata: the number of results was too small. Since the outcome remained the same when modifying our queries multiple times, we decided to change the query by investigating the amount of rock bands and artists from every country. <br>
<br>
- During the process of working on the Melody story, a significant technical issue was discovered. It was observed that modifying or removing templates proved to be a tedious task, as it occasionally resulted in unintended deletion of queries or prevented the execution of actions. The software consistently displays a dialog window containing an error message in different cases. In the end, the story was created and published using another account.
